## Content
- **Conduit Necklace**: hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
- **Creeper Belt**: prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
- **Enderman Anklet**: prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
- **Silverfish Bangle**: converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
- **Phantom Cloak**: deters phantoms, just like cats do

<br>

## Intents & Goals
- Provide useful utilities against annoying mobs or unwanted game mechanics
- Enhance gameplay without conveying a feeling of becoming too overpowered or trivializing mob interactions
- Be modpack and contribution friendly (many config options, easy gating of progression when altering recipes, resources licensed under MIT, etc.)

<br>

## Installation
1. Create a **Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1 instance with [the NeoForge modloader.](https://neoforged.net/)**  
  Using a launcher like [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) will simplify this process.
2. Download the latest Mob Mementos mod jar from the [**releases page**](https://github.com/the-drunken-cod/Mob-Mementos/releases) (or add it via your launcher).
3. Download the latest version of the mod [**Accessories**](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/versions?l=neoforge&g=1.21.1) (or add it via your launcher).
4. Place both .jar files into the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance if you have downloaded them manually.  
  If the folder doesn't exist yet, you can create it yourself.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!  
  After launching, you can modify the config file via the in-game options menu (Mods > "Mob Mementos" > Config) or by editing the file located at `config/mob_mementos-startup.toml` in your Minecraft instance folder.  
  A restart might be required for the more fundamental changes to take effect (i.e. item properties like durability, enabling/disabling items, etc.).

- If you're hosting a server, make sure to install both Mob Mementos and Accessories on the server as well.

        - Configurable amount of uses before the charm breaks or needs to be recharged
- [ ] &lt;P7&gt; Fabric Support
