## Content
### Talismans
- **Conduit Necklace**: hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
- **Creeper Belt**: prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
- **Enderman Anklet**: prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
- **Silverfish Bangle**: converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
- **Phantom Cloak**: deters phantoms, just like cats do

<br>

## Intents & Goals
- Provide useful utilities against annoying mobs
- Enhance gameplay without conveying a feeling of becoming too overpowered or trivializing mob interactions
- Occupy the more rarely used accessory slots
- Be modpack friendly (many config options, easy gating of progression when altering recipes)

<br>

## Installation
1. Create a **Minecraft Java Edition v1.21.1 instance with [the NeoForge modloader.](https://neoforged.net/)**  
  Using a launcher like [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) will simplify this process.
2. Download the latest Mob Talismans mod jar from the [**releases page.**](https://github.com/the-drunken-cod/MobTalismans/releases)
3. Download the latest version of the mod [**Accessories.**](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/versions?l=neoforge&g=1.21.1)
4. Place both .jar files into the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!  
  After launching, you can modify the config file via the in-game options menu (Mods > "Mob Talismans" > Config) or by editing the file located at `./config/mobtalismans-startup.toml` in your Minecraft instance folder.  
  A restart might be required for the more fundamental changes to take effect (i.e. item properties like durability, enabling/disabling items, etc.).

<br>

## Modpack Policy
You are free to use Mob Talismans in any modpacks; public or private :)  
Just make sure you abide by [the Minecraft EULA](https://minecraft.net/en-us/eula)<!-- (even if they themselves don't) -->, common sense, and [our license.](./LICENSE.txt)  
Please also [report any issues or suggestions](https://github.com/the-drunken-cod/MobTalismans/issues), so we can improve the mod for you and other players and have better compatibility with other mods.

## Ideas & Roadmap
- &lt;P1&gt; Accessories that are somewhat expensive to make that make mobs less annoying or offer other utilities tied to mobs
    - [x] &lt;P1&gt; Durability that is used up when the effect triggers
    - [x] &lt;P1&gt; Talismans:
        - [x] &lt;P1&gt; **Conduit Necklace**: hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
        - [x] &lt;P1&gt; **Creeper Belt**: prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
        - [x] &lt;P1&gt; **Enderman Anklet**: prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
        - [x] &lt;P1&gt; **Silverfish Bangle**: converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
        - [x] &lt;P1&gt; **Phantom Cloak**: deters phantoms, just like cats do
    - [ ] &lt;P2&gt; Rendering models
    - [ ] &lt;P2&gt; Recharging mechanic
    - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; More Talismans:
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Bat** (glasses): prevents bats from spawning nearby
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Bee**: prevents beehives from becoming agitated when harvesting or breaking them
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Frog**: nearby frogs drop froglight when eating normal slimes
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Ghast**: reflects ghast fireballs
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Glow Squid** (face/hat): underwater night vision
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Hoglin**: repels hoglins like warped fungi
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Piglin**: prevents nearby piglins from becoming hostile when not wearing gold armor, opening chests or mining gold
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Shulker**: applies slow falling after levitation runs out
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Vex**: makes vex despawn faster (or smaller radius around their summoning evoker)
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Wandering Trader** (charm): prevents wandering traders from spawning in a big radius
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Warden** (shoes): nearby shriekers have a chance to not activate, nearby wardens can't sniff for the player anymore
        - [ ] &lt;P3&gt; **Zombie** (charm): permanently makes nearby zombies unable to spawn reinforcements and break down doors
- [ ] &lt;P4&gt; Placeable Charms:
    - **Evoker**: used on beds & respawn anchors to make them a single-use fallback spawnpoint
        - Any other bed can be used as a temporary spawnpoint, but if they're broken, the player will respawn at their fallback bed/anchor
        - Chat message when the charmed bed/anchor is used or broken to inform the player
