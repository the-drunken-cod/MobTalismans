# Mob Talismans
NeoForge mod for Java Minecraft 1.21.1 that adds QoL accessories (curios) that provide utilities against annoying mobs, as well as some other fun gadgets.

**Requires [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/versions?l=neoforge)**

<br>

## Goals:
- Provide useful utilities against annoying mobs
- Enhance gameplay without conveying a feeling of becoming too overpowered or trivializing mob interactions
- Occupy the more rarely used accessory slots
- Be modpack friendly (many config options, easy gating of progression when altering recipes)

<br>

## Talismans:
- **Conduit** (necklace): hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
- **Creeper** (belt): prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
- **Enderman** (anklet): prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
- **Silverfish** (wrist): converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
- **Phantom** (cloak): deters phantoms, just like cats do

## Idea:
- &lt;P1&gt; Accessories that are somewhat expensive to make that make mobs less annoying or offer other utilities tied to mobs
    - [x] &lt;P1&gt; Durability that is slowly used up, only while activated
    - [ ] &lt;P1&gt; Talismans:

        - [ ] &lt;P2&gt; **Wandering Trader** (charm): prevents wandering traders from spawning in a big radius
        - [ ] &lt;P2&gt; **Warden** (shoes): shriekers have a chance to not activate, the warden can't sniff the player anymore

        - Any other bed can be used as a temporary spawnpoint, but if they're broken, the player will respawn at their fallback bed/anchor
        - Chat message when the charmed bed/anchor is used or broken to inform the player
